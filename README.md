The following tools were utilised in the creation of this report:

- **Microsoft Excel:** For data cleaning, preparation, and sorting.
  1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
     - Data loading and inspection
     - Data cleaning and formatting
    

- **Microsoft Power BI:** For initial exploration, analysis and visualization of the data.
  
  1. Initial Exploration: This entailed an exploration of the data to develop questions and answers that best align with the objectives of the report. These questions include:
     - What was the total number of Athletes?
     - How gender-inclusive was the sport?
     - How many GenZs participated?
     - How many Athletes were Millenials?
     - What was the male-female distribution of the GenZs?
     - What was the female-male distribution of the Millenials?
 
  2. Data Analysis: During analysis, Conditional Columns were created using DAX functions.

     ```DAX
         If discipline contains Archery Then 1
         Else if discipline contains Athletics Then 2
         Else if discipline contains Badminton Then 3
         Else if discipline contains Basketball Then 4
         Else if discipline contains Boxing Then 5
      ```
         And so on.

     ```DAX
         If YOB is greater than or equal to 1997 Then Gen Z
         Else Millenial
      ```
    
  4. Data Visualization: Cards, Donut Chart and Lines were used to visually plot out the representation and inclusivity trend, including other summarized data.
 
- **GitHUb:** For,
  1. Portfolio Building
  2. Communication
