         Else if discipline contains Boxing Then 5
         ```
         And so on.

         ```DAX
         If YOB is greater than or equal to 1997 Then Gen Z
         Else Millenial
         ```
    
     
  3. Data Visualization: Cards, Donut Chart and Lines were used to visually plot out the representation and inclusivity trend, including other summarized data.
