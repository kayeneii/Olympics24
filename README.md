## Insights
---
These key insights were discovered after an analysis of said data;
   * The total number of Athletes was 2,023.
   * 1997 was the average year of birth of the 2024 Olympic Athletes.
   * 49% of the Athletes were female and 51% were male.
   * Of 2,023 Athletes, 639 were GenZs.
   * 1,384 were Millenials.
   * the male-female GenZ distribution was 341 and 298 respectively.
   * the female-male Millenial distribution was 685 and 695 respectively.
   * The rate of Athletes with refugee status was 0.40%.

Based on these insights, it can be construed that the 2024 Olympic Athletic sport was gender-inclusive with a 49:51 ratio females to males. The representation of GenZs and Millenials during the sport reflect an imbalance in participation between both generations. Furthermore, a 0.40% refugee rate indicate that better opportunities need be granted to refugees in the sport.
